# The-Insurgents-Graveyard
A collection of FFXII LUA scripts that didn't fit into any of my mods or that were requested and created for others. It's important to note that most of these scripts are only used in very specific situations like debuging or modding.


### Camera Position
Shows the position of the currently controlled character while roaming. You can use the **RightControl + End** keys to toggle the state of the script.

### Fixed MP Regeneration
Multiplies the required steps needed to gain 1 MP by the speed mode multiplier. So one can no longer abuse the speed-mode by running around in circles to regain a lot of MP.

### Forced Fighting Stance
Forces all party members into a fighting stance if they enter a location that is not a town.

### Forced Keyboard Button Prompts
Forces the game to always use keyboard button prompts. 

### Forced PS Button Prompts
Forces the game to always use PS button prompts, no matter what kind of controller is connected.

### Forced Xbox Button Prompts
Forces the game to always use XBOX button prompts, no matter what kind of controller is connected.

### Lift Story Restrictions
Allows the usage of the following things from the start of the game: Party-, equipment-, licenses- and gambits menu, world and minimap, clan primer and much more.

### No Heal On Save Crystals
Touching save crystals will no longer restore HP, MP, etc.

### No Mist Bar Restore On Save Crystals
Touching save crystal will no longer restore mist bars.

### No Overlay Map
Disables the overlay map which would displayed in the middle of the screen after pressing/clicking the Tab/L3/LS key/button.

### No Sounds
Disables all sound input from the game. It's mostly meant to be used when modding, so you don't have to constantly adjust the sound settings per savefile, nor get your ear blasted every time you enter the main menu.

### No Speed Mode
Disables the ability to toggle the speed mode feature of the game which may be of some use for the speedrunning community.

### No Teleport Requirement
Teleport stones are no longer required when using the save crystal teleport option.

### Perfect HP/MP Bonus Growth
Removes the randomness factor of a character's HP/MP growth when leveling up (more information [here](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XII_stats#cite_ref-ff12_1-1))

### Removeable Targeted Party Members
Enables the ability to remove any targeted party members from the party.
