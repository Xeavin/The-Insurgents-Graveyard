# The Insurgent's Graveyard
A collection of FFXII scripts that were either requested and created for others, or are too niche to be included in any of my other mods.

## Scripts
The following features are available both as a LUA script (Steam) and as a cheat table (Steam/Microsoft Store). The former works automatically once installed where as the latter needs to be run manually after every game launch. Choose whatever works best for you.

### Always Spawn Treasures
Treasure always spawn, no matter their spawn chance or uniqueness (configurable).

### Always Steal Everything
Stealing is always successful, includes all items, but is still limited to once per foe. For continuous stealing, you can use the **Unlimited Stealable Foe Items** feature of [The Insurgent's Bountiful Bundle](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy12/mods/185)

### Fixed MP Regeneration
Multiplies the number of steps necessary to gain 1 MP by the speed mode multiplier. So it is no longer possible to exploit the speed-mode by running around in circles to regain a lot of MP.

### Forced Fighting Stance
Forces all party members into a fighting stance if they enter a location that is not a town.

### Forced Keyboard Button Prompts
Forces the game to always use keyboard button prompts, as long as no controller is used.

### Forced PS Button Prompts
Forces the game to always use PS button prompts, regardless of the type of controller used.

### Forced Xbox Button Prompts
Forces the game to always use XBOX button prompts, regardless of the type of controller used.

### Lift Story Restrictions
Allows the usage of the following things from the start of the game: Party-, equipment-, licenses- and gambits menu, world and minimap, clan primer and much more.

### No Restoration On Save Crystals
Touching save crystals will no longer restore HP, MP, etc. or remove any negative status effects.

### No Overlay Map
Disables the overlay map which would displayed in the middle of the screen after pressing/clicking the Tab/L3/LS key/button.

### No Mist Bar Restoration On Save Crystals
Touching save crystals will no longer restore mist bars. Furthermore, mist bars will not be restored after a cutscene that initiates a boss battle.

### No Overhead Party HP Bars
Removes the overhead HP bars of the party.

### No Overhead Foe HP Bars
Removes the overhead HP bars of foes (incl. friendly).

### No Sounds
Disables all sound input from the game. It's mostly meant to be used when modding, so you don't have to constantly adjust the sound settings per savefile, nor get your ear blasted every time you enter the main menu.

### No Speed Mode
Disables the ability to toggle the speed mode feature of the game.

### No Teleport Requirement
Teleport stones are no longer required when using the save crystal teleport option.

### Perfect HP/MP Bonus Growth
Removes the randomness factor of a character's HP/MP growth when leveling up (more information [here](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XII_stats#cite_ref-ff12_1-1))

### Removeable Targeted Party Members
Enables the ability to remove any targeted party members from the party.

### Summons For All
Allows a summon to be acquired by all characters.

## Compatibility
- Fully compatible with other mods, unless they incorporate the same changes which should be mentioned in their description.
- Fully compatible with all game languages.
- Fully compatible with existing saves (no new game required).
- Only compatible with either the latest Steam (1.0.4.0) or Microsoft Store (1.0.1.0) version of the game.

## Configuration
Some scripts come with configurable parameters that are saved into its specific config file (e.g. **{game}/x64/scripts/config/AlwaysSpawnTreasuresConfig.lua**). You can modify this configuration file with any text editor if needed. For example, if you would like the **Always Spawn Treasures** script to not affect unique treasures, then you can do so by changing **uniqueState** in the config file from **false** to **true**.

## Notes
- Instead of using both the **No Overhead Party HP Bars** and **No Overhead Foe HP Bars** option, you can also just use the **No Overhead HP Bars** option of [The Insurgent's Vision](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy12/mods/220).
